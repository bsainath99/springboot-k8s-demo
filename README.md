# Kubernetes Integration with Spring Boot

In this project, I have implemented Spring Boot application, and integrated using Kubernetes for orchestration of an application.

Spring Boot Application with just one end-point **/meesage** and retunr a string.
The main point is integrating it with Kubernetes and do the build automatically.
